Indeed, with these parameters, we have $\\log_2 \\left( \\epsilon_{\\text{FRI-queries}} \\right) = s \\cdot \\log_2 \\left( \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot m} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\geq -s$, where the latter holds even in the limit as $m \\rightarrow \\infty$. Paradoxically, the larger proximity parameters Conjecture 8.4 makes possible—i.e., in the range $\\theta \\geq 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho}$—don't help us here, _unless_ we also make further conjectures about the list-decodability of Reed–Solomon codes up to capacity. Sure enough, the proof of [[Haböck](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1216.pdf), Theorem 8] relies on the list-decodability of the Reed–Solomon code $\\mathsf{RS}_{k^+}(K, D)$, where $K := F(Z)$ is the infinite function field over $F$ in one indeterminate. This latter list decodability will fail as soon as $\\theta \\geq 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho^+}$.\n",
