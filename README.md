# Computing Conjectured Security 

This repo contains in-process analysis of RISC Zero's security level in both the proven and conjectured security. 
Many thanks to the team at Ulvetanna for sharing this analysis. 

A PDF version of the doc (as of June 16, 2023) is available as a [google doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuY4QbuMJ5Oe6oIvGVlipZWSfjjq1XFV/view?usp=drive_link).
It seems that the proven security analysis here is complete and in order, but the conjectured analysis mertis more review. 

Feel free to make comments on the google doc or open PRs in order to suggest corrections or otherwise move this project forward.
